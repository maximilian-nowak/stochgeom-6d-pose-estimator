# stochgeom-6d-pose-estimator

This Project includes the code of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to implement a stochastic geometrical framework as introduced in [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-024-01200-2#citeas) paper and compare it with a neural network. In this case the method as applied to 6d pose estimation through multilateration.
